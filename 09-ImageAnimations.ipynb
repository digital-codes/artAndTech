    "## Image Animations\n",
    "When we modify the content of an image at a sufficient rate, we cannot track the individual scenes but instead get the impression of continuous *motion*. So the primarey differency between still image and movie is that the movie has many images in a given time while the still image has only one. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of images per second is called image frequency, or very often *frame-rate*, and a *frame* describes the individual items we show (or process) and can be used in other contextes as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physiologically the frame-rate needs to be between 20 to 25 Hz (images per second) to create the motion impression. Technically we aim for values like 25, 30, 50 or 60 Hz which corresponds to the electrical grid frequencies in non-US and US countries (50 or 60 Hz resp.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note there is also a movie style called *stop-motion* which uses a frame-rate so low, that we can still see images. This can create interesting effects too. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a (very simple) movie we have to update our image source frequently enough and merge the images into a video file format. \n"
