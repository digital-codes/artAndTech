    "## Basic Programming Elements\n",
    "We start here to introduce some fundamental elements of programming\n",
    " * Functions\n",
    " * Loops\n",
    " * Conditions\n",
    " \n",
    " Functions are used to define code sections which are used repeatedly. Instead of writing the same code\n",
    " over and over again, we write the code in a specific paragraph with a name and *call* it via this name\n",
    " whenever we need the functionality. We can also provide parameters on every call, in this example the\n",
    " number of items to print and the color.\n",
    " \n",
    " Functions provide structure to our code and enable modular programming, as we can move functions into files\n",
    " which can improve code readability.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " Loops are another way to repeat stuff but at a different level: they actually control the execution of statements in the program. \n",
    " There are different kinds of loops:\n",
    "   * The *FOR* loop in the segment function repeats an action for a certain number of times\n",
    "   * The *WHILE* loop in the main body reapeats an action while a certain *condition* is true\n",
    " \n",
    " Conditions are logic statements which resolve to either *True* or *False*, like *5 < 3* (which is False). The result is typically used to decide upon subsequent actions via *IF - ELSE* statemets or in *WHILE* loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course we have all the typcall mathematical and logical operators like \n",
    "> +, + , * , / , AND, OR, NOT\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we create  a simply checker-board type pattern by printing 0's or 1's.\n",
    "Modify the constants and check the results."
